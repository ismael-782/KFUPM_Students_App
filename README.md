# **KFUPM Student App** 

**Project Overview:**

The **KFUPM Student App** was developed during the **Flutter Weekend Hackathon**, a collaborative event organized by **Google Students Developer CLUB @ KFUPM** and the **KFUPM Computer Club**. Sponsored by the **KFUPM IT Team**, the hackathon aimed to address numerous student complaints regarding the old app. It encouraged participants to create an innovative and more user-friendly app to improve the student experience on campus. We are **proud to announce that we secured 2nd place** in the competition, which was a testament to our teamâ€™s effort and vision.
